1. How to build this ftp server?
0) #tar -zvxf ftp_server.tar.gz

   want to put your file of users' infomation.
2) #make
3) #./ftp_server
	or
   #./ftp_server [port]
4) enjoy :-)

2. How to stop the server? 
	#killall -9 ftp_server

3. How to add a ftp user?
1) The easiest way is to use perl script ftp_addu.pl like this:
	./ftp_addu.pl -u username -p passwd -d <home directory> -l level
	<home directory> 
		It is the directory user works after login, and the user 
		can't access upper directories.
	<level>
        	level is a number from 0 to 3 which tells the user's power.
		level 0 -- list
		level 1 -- list & download
		level 2 -- list & upload
		level 3 -- list & download & upload
2) If you can't work with the script, edit file userinfo yourself please.
   Its format is:
	username:crypted password:home directory:level
   You can get crypted password from adding an temporary user to your system.
   Do it like this,
	#useradd tmpuser
	#passwd tmpuser
	<---enter the password you want to set.
        #cat /etc/shadow | grep ^tmpuser: | awk -F\: '{print $2}'
	then copy the output characters as crypted password in the file userinfo.

4 How to delete a ftp user?
1) #./ftp_delu.pl -u username
2) If you can't work with the script, edit file userinfo yourself please. Just
   find and delete the line begin with username:, and it will work.

5 Examples
  You can find a file named userinfo which contains 4 users:
  	anonymous/anonymous, guest/guest, icymoon/icymoon, aleph/aleph 
  with 4 different level, from 0 to 3.
  You can test the program with these users. Of course you can also add or delete 
  users yourself. Thank you.
